# Norovirus
Nextstrain analysis of Norovirus

## Introduction
This is the Nextstrain build for Norovirus

## Data Curation
All sequence data is from Vipr or Genbank. The full Norovirus genomic length is ~7,547 bp long. In this build, we filtered for human Norovirus sequences that are at least 5032bp long (2/3 of the full length). We ended up with a dataset of 2734 sequences from 1968-2022, from 42 countries.
